The U.S. Needs to honor its long standing commitment to the defense of Taiwan. If as is put forth here there is concern over the growing ability and accuracy of China's ballistic missiles the solution needs to be the inclusion of Taiwan in the Aegis ashore missile defense program as well as upgrading Taiwan's Patriot air defense batteries to the latest PAC-3 missiles and associated radar systems. None of this is offensive in nature and only can threaten China to the extent that it reduces China's ability to threaten Taiwan. Not selling Taiwan the latest defense hardware because we are concerned that China will stop selling us cheap consumer products may be a foreign policy but it's not a very wise one.,missile defense,FAVOR,1,invalid

For those who claim it will run up electric prices by burning more oil, they just don't realize that coal burning electric plants never shut down. One can't save electricity. You don't turn the plant off at night just because demand is low. That's why charging cars at night makes so much sense.

Some components of a strict parenting style - focus on learning, expectation of achievement, insistence on responsibility, consideration of the future - support that primary goal.

Some components of a strict parenting style - focus on learning, expectation of achievement, insistence on responsibility, consideration of the future - support that primary goal.

This requires practice, which means they must be allowed to make decisions and experience the consequences thereof. Children must learn to deal with others, including the range of personalities and opinions that exist in the society around them. Isolating them will not achieve this.

So if a person saved $50,000 and earned 5% interest, they would pay taxes only on the $2,500 in interest. The original $50,000 would remain untaxed. How is this any different than a person that invested the $50,000 into a business and then paid themselves a salary Likewise, with corporations, firms only pay taxes on their earnings. Corporations get to deduct all other expenses. So a person that owns a company could avoid the 'double taxation' issue by taking a salary instead of taking income in terms of profits.

They should not be allowed to participate if they do not attend the school. School districts have requirements to play. If a student gets low grades they are not allowed to play on a team or if they were absent from school they can't play that day. Home schooled kids would be able to circumvent the rules and might entice other athletes to do the same - leave the academic environment just to continue playing. For whatever reasons the parents chose to pull their kids from public education. The sports program is part of the education. Allowing parents to pick and choose will only harm the quality of education as a whole. With the current problems we are facing with the dwindling middle class the last thing we need is a public education system that isn't strong in academics. If parents are allowed to pull their kids from the academics and pick and choose the extra curricula activities then public schools will become a camp.

No simply answer. I serviced machines at a produce packing plant where all the workers were laid off after a fire. When the plant reopened the black local based work force was replaced with an immigrant crew provided by a labor contractor.

Fifty years ago migrant crews were blacks who followed the harvest seasons up and down the East coast. With liberal welfare policies they could stay in one place. Farmers who still needed workers came to depend on contractors who would supply illegals. Forcing blacks off of welfare and busing them to farm jobs would probably not go over very well.

Athletes recruited (or volunteering) for either sport should not be expected to enroll for degrees or take classes. They may opt to do so, but must achieve and have access to certain kinds of academic support. Those athletes in either sport who opt not to enroll or who enroll but find they must drop out would be assured places as students for (pick a number of years), beyond the their collegiate playing days. Frankly, I'd prefer simply to force the NFL and the NBA to set up a separate minor league system, as MLB has for many decades. But, given alumni and other pressures, that is unlikely. So, admit the true nature of the relationship (of great advantage to NFL owners) and work around it, without compromising the academic enterprise.",unacknowledged minor league,AGAINST,1,invalid

It is not the fault of these idealistic and/or ambitious young people that the program has been overly touted as the silver bullet for all education's problems. There is nothing wrong with leaving education after two years, becoming an administrator or going to law school. The problem is that attrition is basically a design feature of the program. An unprepared teacher in a high needs classroom will burn out in two years. I almost did, until I realized that I needed to set boundaries and have a life. The problem is that students pay by losing energetic teachers every year, would-be teachers are discouraged and leave the classroom, and the taxpayers are footing too much of the bill for a program with questionable returns.

That fear draws ample support from the powers that most fear that outcome and it tends to place those resources in the hands of the most destabilizing forces in the opposition which include the most militant of islamists and those bearing the greatest ressentinent against Shiites and minority groups in Syria. The only way to stanch that flow of resources is to at least supply the most acceptable opposition forces and to marginalize the more dangerous opposition actors. What all this means is that intervention is inevitable and that the cost and complexity of intervention only increases with time. Our response to this crisis will be studied for decades as the primary example of how nonintervention bears the same if not greater human costs as intervention.",inter-rater relations,AGAINST,1,invalid

Assad uses horrible means to stay in power but we should not forget that before the trouble started he was quite popular and many assume that he might win free elections.

Citizenship takes the universal human sense of membership in a community, and association with persons one sees every day and interacts with in many ways, and extends it in the imagination to a much larger circle, the nation. Such 'imagined community' is valuable in spurring solidarity and shared commitments beyond the local, but it is also vulnerable to emotional intensification and mythomania.

Bicycle riding us much easier and safer, and most people ride a bicycle before they get on a motorcycle. Does it make sense to ban bicycles in order to prevent the harms of motorcycle riding?

The TFA alumni who leave teaching for other careers retain their knowledge of the real conditions of poor children and their schools. They can and do give voice to those realities in political debates and can counter the many (often willfully) ignorant claims of opponents of public education. Just as Peace Corp volunteers are a source of reality about the Third World, so TFA alumni can and do continue to advocate for poor children and their schools when they become investment bankers, lawyers, or other high earners. Such advocacy doesn't direct benefit the children they taught, but it will benefit public education. TFA recognizes that we need to change the political debate over public education as much as we need to get top graduates into schools as teachers. Rather than harp on the limits of TFA, we should recognize that Wendy Kopp has found a way to move politics in a progressive direction and spend our efforts applying its lessons to other areas of public policy and politics.",family values,NONE,1,Pseudo
